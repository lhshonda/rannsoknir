The change in position or orientation of an object with time. 

`In the case of a vehicle moving, its wheels are changing in position, but at the same time the orientation, due to rotation, at any point on the wheel, its orientation is also changing.

> Kinds of motion

- [[Linear Motion]] (1-D)
- [[Projectile Motion]]
- [[Circular Motion]]
- [[Rotational Motion]]

[[Trajectory]] is the path traced by the object

> Conceptual Model

A **point particle** (particle model), is the conceptual model in physics that represents an object to be concentrated at a single model. 

**Event diagrams** are cartoon images of a moving object at each distinct event in its motion.
	e.g. 'starts to move' 'begins to speed up' 'comes to a stop'

**Motion path diagrams** show an object's position at several equally spaced instants of time.
	e.g. 'stationary' 'constant speed' 'speeding up' 'slowing down'
