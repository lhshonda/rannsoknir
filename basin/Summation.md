The addition of a [[Sequence|sequence]] of numbers. The result is the sum/total. Summations of [[Infinite|infinite]] sequences are called [[Series|series]].

>Shortcuts in summation

These formulas save us from tedious amounts of additions through proven mathematical facts.

$$
\begin{gather} 
\text{Sum of the first }n\text{ integers.} \\ \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i=1+2+3+\dots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\
\end{gather}
$$
$$
\begin{gather} \\
\text{Sum of the first }n\text{ squares.} \\ \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{2}=1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+\dots+n^{2}= \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \\
\end{gather}
$$
$$
\begin{gather} \\
\text{Sum of the first }n\text{ cubes.} \\ \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{3}=1^{3}+2^{3}+3^{3}+\dots+n^{3}=\left[ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right]^{2} \\ \\
\end{gather}
$$

If you, for instance, had to add all of integers between 1 and 100 including themselves, you might take several minutes to do so without some trick. Mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss, noticed a pair relationship between the numbers.

$$
\begin{gather} \\
1+100=101 \\
2+\ \ 99=101 \\
3+\ \ 98=101 \\
\text{... and so on.} \\ \\
\end{gather}
$$
With this pair-like relationship in mind, it becomes evident that in this case we have 50 such pairs. Multiply the common sum of each pair by the number of pairs and you get the summation. Denoted as an **arithmetic sequence**, this pairing trick may be used to find the sum of any such sequence.
