The method through which numbers too large or too small in their decimal form are conveniently expressed. Common names received may include: scientific form, standard index form, or standard form.

Nonzero numbers are written as such:

$$
m*10^n
$$

`m` : the coefficient, a nonzero real number (usually between 1 & 10)
`n` : an integer, also the exponent.

$$
2 = 2*10^0
$$
$$
300 = 3*10^2
$$
$$
0.00000000751=7.51*10^{-9}
$$
$$
0.2=2*10^{-1}
$$

This base ten notation is commonly used by scientists in a variety of fields.

Write your numbers in scientific notation by visualizing the movement of the decimal point in order to determine your exponent. 

Moving it left increments the number positively. Predictably, moving the decimal to the right increments the exponent negatively.
