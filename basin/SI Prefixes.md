In the [[International System of Units (SI)|International System of Units]], an SI Prefix, also known as metric prefix, is a unit prefix preceding a basic unit of measure in order to denote a multiple or submultiple of said unit. 

Prefixes like kilo or milli, for example, are both represented by unique symbols. 

In the case of $kg$, kilo precedes gram and indicates a multiplication of one thousand. One gram would be 1g, whilst 1kg would signify 1000 grams in quantity.

When converting units, it is useful to note:

$$
x(\text{prefix A}) = x \times 10^{e_{A} - e_{B}} \text{ (prefix B)}
$$

...where $e_{A}$ and $e_{B}$ denote the powers of ten for the prefixes. For example:

$$
2.07 \times 10^{-3}\text{ km}=2.07\times 10^{3}\text{ m}
$$

This is due to $e_{A}-e_{B}=3-0$, since the powers of ten for meter and kilometer are 0, and 3 respectively. Thus, prefix symmetry, denoting every metric prefix as a power of ten, allows for quick conversions through said formula.
