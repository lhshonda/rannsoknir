From a [[Compiler (CS)|compiler's]] perspective, object construction first allocates the memory for the [[Object (CS)|object]]. From there is [[Constructor (CS)|constructor]] is automatically called and the [[Reference Variable (CS)|reference]] to the object is created.





<h5 align="center">Three Conceptual Steps in Object Construction</h5>

1. A [[Variable (CS)|variable]] serves as a [[Reference Variable (CS)|named reference]] to the [[Object (CS)|object]] in memory.
</br>
2. Memory is allocated for the object before use. Some languages handle this part automatically, while others require you to be explicit, and use [[Reserved Word|reserved words]].
</br>
3. A [[Constructor (CS)|constructor]] sets up the object's initial state. Many [[Programming Languages|programming languages]] provide multiple ways to initialize an object.
