##### Java

>The new operator explicitly allocates an object of the specified class type. 

Ex: `Restaurant favLunchPlace = new Restaurant();` creates a Restaurant object named favLunchPlace.


>The "." operator, known as the member access operator, is used to invoke a method on an object. 

Ex: `favLunchPlace.setRating(4)` calls the setRating() method on the favLunchPlace object, which sets the object's rating to 4.

##### C-Sharp

You use several operators and expressions to access a type member. 
Member access operators include:

```
member access (`.`)
array element, or indexer access (`[]`)
index-from-end (`^`)
range (`..`)
null-conditional operators (`?.` and `?[]`)
method invocation (`()`) 
```

These operators include the _null-conditional_ member access (`?.`), and indexer access (`?[]`) operators.
