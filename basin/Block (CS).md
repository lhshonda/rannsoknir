A group of [[Statement (CS)|statements]] treated a single unit in a program. Blocks are typically enclosed by braces `{}` in languages like Java, C, or JavaScript. They're used to define the body of [[Method (CS)|methods]], [[Function (CS)|functions]], [[Loop (CS)|loops]], [[Conditional (CS)|conditionals]], and [[Class (OOP)|classes]]. 

Blocks are often used to create [[Local Scope (CS)|local scopes]]. [[Variable (CS)|Variables]] declared within a block are typically only accessible within that block.
