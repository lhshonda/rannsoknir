The action of invoking a [[Method|method]] on an [[Objects (CS)|object]] or [[Class (OOP)|class]] so as to execute its behavior. In the method call statement, any required [[Argument (CS)|arguments]] are passed into it. These calls allow objects or programs to perform specific tasks without the need to duplicate logic.

Method calls allow programmers to keep their code [[DRY]], and more maintainable.
