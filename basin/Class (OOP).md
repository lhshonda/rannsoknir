A **class** defines the traits of [[Object (CS)|objects]] created from said class. Objects created from the blueprint of a class during [[Object Construction (CS)|construction]] are instances of that class. 

The application of classes may slightly differ in use between [[Programming Languages|programming languages]], but generally, they share their [[Variable (CS)|variables]] and [[Method (CS)|methods]]. Those two things, respectively, define their state and behavior. 

Classes are usually written with the [[Pascal Case|pascal case]] naming convention.
