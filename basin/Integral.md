An integral is the [[Infinity|infinity]] approaching [[Limit|limit]] of a [[Function|function's]] sum: it's the exact area under a curve.

#####  Common Pitfalls

1. The integral calculates net signed [[Area|area]]. That is, any area below the x-axis counts as negative. 

2. A [[Definite Integral|definite integral]] is a number representing an area in a given [[Interval|interval]], while an [[Indefinite Integral|indefinite integral]] is a function known as the [[Antiderivative|antiderivative]].

3. The $dx$ is essential as it denotes the [[Variable|variable]] we integrate in respect to, and represents the width of the rectangles within the defining [[Summation|sum]].
