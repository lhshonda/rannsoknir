This fundamental concept in kinematics is considered a [[Vector Quantity|vector quantity]]. Velocity's scalar. also know as its [[Magnitude|magnitude]], is [[Speed|speed]].

###### Average Velocity

This is defined by an object's change in position, $\Delta s$, divided by the duration of the period during which it changed position ($\Delta t$).
$$
\bar{v}=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}
$$
###### Instantaneous Velocity

This is what average velocity becomes when a single instant in time is infinitely approached. In order to do so the limit of the instance is solved for.
$$
v = \lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}=\frac{ds}{dt}
$$
