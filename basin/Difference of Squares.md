A pattern coming from the subtraction (difference) of [[Perfect Square|perfect squares]] such as $a^{2}-b^{2}$. A difference of squares always [[Factor|factors]] into the same two terms. One with a plus, the other with a minus.

$$
\begin{gather}
a^{2}-b^{2} = (a-b)(a+b)
\end{gather}
$$


The pattern can be observed when you begin to look for perfect squares in cases like $x^{2}-9$.
You may immediately pick up that $x^{2}$ is the perfect square for $x$, and $9$ for $3$. 

>The difference is the subtraction symbol between the two perfect squares!

$$
\begin{gather}
x^{2}-9 \text{ is turn, is the same as  } (x+3)(x-3)\\
\end{gather}
$$

You are not limited to perfect squares and you can utilize this pattern by representing the factored terms with irrational numbers such as $\sqrt{ 3 }$. 

$$
\begin{gather}
x^{2}-3 \text{ is the same as }(x+\sqrt{ 3 })(x-\sqrt{ 3 })
\end{gather}
$$
