Internationally known as **SI** coming from the French name, “Système international d’unités”. This is the modern form of the metric system. It is composed of a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|Coherent Set of Units]].
###### Base Units

	Second(s): time
	Metre(m): length
	Kilogram(kg): mass
	Ampere(A): electric current
	Kelvin(K): thermodynamic temperature
	Mole(mol): amount of substance
	Candela(cd): luminous intensity

From these base units, you may build [[Derived Units]]. This is accomplish through their combinations with multiplication, division, and exponents.

There are an infinite amount of possible derived units one could make. SI adorns 22 of them with special names & symbols.

Coherency in short means that no abstract constants are necessary. The pure powers of base units were used for the derivation.

[[Dimension]] in this context refers to the kind of physical quantity.
