A methodology for testing source code in order to evaluate its state and behavior. Several test cases are devised to test singular pieces of the program in a separate manner. A complete testing suite will allow for potential regressions or further issues to be caught in an efficacious manner.

The core idea is the isolation/verification of the smallest testable units of an application, such as a function or method, in order to ensure they behave as expected.
