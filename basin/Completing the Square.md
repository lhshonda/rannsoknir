A method used to solve [[Quadratic Equations|quadratic equations]], where you look to create a [[Perfect Square|perfect square]] on one side of the equation.

$$
10x^{2}-30x-8=0
$$

Lead with the simplification. Divide out common terms, 10 in this case. 

$$
x^{2}-3x-\frac{4}{5}=0
$$
Factoring is difficult when faced with fractions. When opting to complete the square move the fraction to the other side.
$$
x^{2}-3x=\frac{4}{5}
$$
Now turn the left hand side into the perfect square of a binomial. Attain the missing integer by squaring the quotient of the coefficient of $x$.
$$
\left( \frac{-3}{2} \right)^{2}=\frac{9}{4}
$$
Add it to both sides as you may not change one side without changing the other. Match denominators and add appropriately in this case.
$$
x^{2}-3x+\frac{9}{4}=\frac{61}{20}
$$
The missing integer for the binomial was attained earlier and and will now be used to show the perfect square. The squared version of that integer was needed in order to add it to the other side.
$$
\left( x-\frac{3}{2} \right)^{2}=\frac{61}{20}
$$
Now solve for $x$ and remember that a square root produces $\pm$ values.
$$
x=\frac{3}{2}\pm \sqrt{ \frac{61}{20} }
$$
