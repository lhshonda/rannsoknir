:: [[Scientific Notation]]
###### Addition & Subtraction

In order to perform addition and subtraction both of the numbers must be represented by the same exponential part. 

Set the numbers to the larger exponent in the event they do not match. Convert the coefficient accordingly by moving its decimal place.

$$1.562\times 10^{5}+8.9\times 10^{3}=1.562\times 10^{5}+0.089\times 10^{5}$$

Now you may add the coefficients: $1.651\times 10^{5}$

###### Multiplication & Division

When performing operations in scientific notation such as multiplication & divisions, you are to use to the rules for operation with [[Exponentiation]].

The coefficients are multiplied/divided & the exponents added/subtracted by one another.

$$
(3.4 \times 10^{5})\times {(4.7 \times 10^{2})} = 15.98\times 10^{7}
$$

Lastly, reduce the coefficient below a value of 10 if necessary: $1.598 \times 10^{8}$

##### Adnotanda

$$
3.0000 \text{ has 5 significant figures, but 3.0 only has 2 significant figures.}
$$

$$
\text{The number of significant figures used for the product of two numbers is denoted}\atop\text{by factor with the least significant figures. }
$$

$$

(3.0000 \times 10^{3})\times(3.0\times 10^{2})=9.0\times 10^{5}\atop
\text{The result is represented by 2 significant figures in this case.}

$$

In the event you are to perform operations with exact numbers they would not change the number of significant figures for a result. It is acceptable to keep one or two extra digits during intermediate steps of a calculation. 

You are looking to minimize the round-off errors in the calculation, thus you may keep all digits if possible. The 1-2 extra digit rule is there for convenience and contextual sufficiency.
