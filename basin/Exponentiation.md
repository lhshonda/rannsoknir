**Exponentiation** is an operation involving two numbers: $b^{n}$

`b` : the base
`n` : exponent or power 

$$b^{n} = \underbrace{ b\times b\times\dots \times b\times b }_{\text{n …}}$$

This definition of $b^n$ implies several properties:

**Multiplication Property** 

Given base $b$ raised to some amount, if said base is multiplied by itself, then this operation would be the same as raising $b$ to the two exponents added together. 

$b^{n}\times b^{m}=\underbrace{ b\times\dots \times b }_{ \text{n …} } \times \underbrace{ b\times\dots \times b }_{ \text{m …} }=\underbrace{ b\times\dots \times b }_{ \text{n + m …} }=b^{n+m}$
