An operation involving two numbers: $b^{n}$

$$
\begin{gather}
b^{n} = \underbrace{ b\times b\times\dots \times b\times b }_{\text{n …}} \\ \\
b \text{ is the base, and n represents the exponent or power.}
\end{gather}
$$

##### Multiplication Property 

Given base $b$ raised to some amount, if said base is multiplied by itself, then this operation would be the same as raising $b$ to the two exponents added together. 


$$
\begin{gather} \\
b^{n}\times b^{m}=\underbrace{ b\times\dots \times b }_{ \text{n …} } \times \underbrace{ b\times\dots \times b }_{ \text{m …} }=\underbrace{ b\times\dots \times b }_{ \text{n + m …} }=b^{n+m} \\
\end{gather}
$$

---
##### Division Property

When two exponential expression with the same base are divided their exponents undergo subtraction.

$$
\begin{gather} \\
\frac{x^{a}}{x^{b}}=x^{a-b} \\
\end{gather}
