```
1,000 name tags were printed and sorted by first name into a stack. A person wishes to sort the tags by last name instead.
```

```
For each tag, place the tag into one of 26 substacks, one for last names starting with A, one for B, etc. Then, for each substack's tags (like the A stack), insert that tag into the proper location of a last-name-sorted stack for that letter. Finally, combine the stacks in order (As stack on top, then Bs, etc.).
```
