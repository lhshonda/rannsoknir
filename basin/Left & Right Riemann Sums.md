> Given a curve, we are tasked to find the approximate area underneath it.

![A function is graphed. The x-axis is unnumbered. The graph is a curve. The curve starts on the positive y-axis, moves upward concave up and ends in quadrant 1. An area between the curve and the axes is shaded.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/2447d17ea212e8f0a7047fbd601fe0ec11a1490b.svg)

> We can approximate its area with the use of rectangles.

![The shaded area below the curve is divided into 4 rectangles of equal width. Each rectangle moves upward from the x-axis and touches the curve at the top left corner.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/ac93f880e69a60cf099ec088816630ffa29b5c96.svg)

> The more rectangles we use, the better the approximation becomes.

![The shaded area below the curve is divided into 16 rectangles of equal width.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/cb2a54d448895bb8841fb66f26feded2f49ab037.svg)

> These approximations refer to **Riemann sums**, and become a foundation in integral calculus.

When creating a **Riemann sum**, you must choose the way you're making your rectangles. If you choose to touch the curve with the top-left corners then you would in turn be making a 
**left Riemann sum**. 
![The shaded area below the curve is divided into 4 rectangles of equal width. Each rectangle moves upward from the x-axis and touches the curve at the top left corner. Therefore, each rectangle is below the curve.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/1497d1bafc191b528c65ad143d8367f230304fba.svg)

Touch the top right corners instead, and you're now creating a **right Riemann sum**.
![The shaded area below the curve is divided into 4 rectangles of equal width. Each rectangle moves upward from the x-axis and touches the curve at the top right corner. Therefore, each rectangle moves upward above the curve.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/2d9fe530575792f1a009163bbe9c221182ea2564.svg)

**Riemann sums** contain what we refer to as **subdivisions/partitions**. These terms refer the amount of rectangles used, or rather the number of parts the interval being measured was divided into.

> Uniford subdivision
![The shaded area below the curve is divided into 3 rectangles of equal width. Each rectangle moves upward from the x-axis and touches the curve at the top left corner.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/f8e03b44afea443cd6e99ffd58720b9753d6dccd.svg)

> Nonuniform subdivision
![The shaded area below the curve is divided into 3 rectangles of unequal width. Each rectangle moves upward from the x-axis and touches the curve at the top left corner.](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-graphie/ae51ed7af279323ba82fcaf2ba090d514d888327.svg)
