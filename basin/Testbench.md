A program used to test another program in part, or in its entirety, via input/output checks using test cases. Performing [[Unit Testing|unit tests]] means to create and run testbenches for items like [[Method|methods]] or [[Class (OOP)|classes]].

**Regression testing** is to retest items after making changes. When previously-passed test cases fail after a change, an item has regressed.
