###### Basketball thrown through hoop.
Given a graph of $(x\text{ }(m),y\text{ }(m))$ coordinates defined with points at specific instances of $t\text{(s)}$. 
The $x$ and $y$ coordinate system make up the ball's position at each frame ($\text{time instance}$) throughout the graph. 

The ball's position, for example, could be identified to be:

$$(x_{4}\text{, }y_{4})\atop t=4$$

Alternatively, the position vector specifies the distance and direction from the origin.

$$
\vec{r_{4}} = (15\text{ m}, \text{ }37^{\circ})
$$
