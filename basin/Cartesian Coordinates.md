> Basketball thrown through hoop.

A graph (x, y), is defined with specific instances in respect to time in seconds. 

The $x$ and $y$ coordinate system make up the ball's position at each frame (time instance) throughout the graph. 

The ball's position, for example, could be identified to be:

$$(x_{4}\text{, }y_{4})\atop t=4$$

Alternatively, the position vector specifies the distance and direction from the origin.

$$
\vec{r_{4}} = (15\text{ m}, \text{ }37^{\circ})
$$
