A **programming language** is a formal system of human-readable instructions that allows people to communicate with computers and create software. Each language provides its own [[Syntax|syntax]], features, and [[API Documentation|documentation]] to guide development.

Some languages are designed for general-purpose use, while others are specialized for particular tasks. Trade-offs can appear in performance, readability, ease of use, and the range of capabilities offered.
