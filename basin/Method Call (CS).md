The action of invoking a [[Method (CS)|method]] on an [[Object (CS)|object]] or [[Class (OOP)|class]] to execute its behavior. In the method call statement, any required [[Argument (CS)|arguments]] are passed into it. These calls allow objects or programs to perform specific tasks without the need to duplicate logic, and allowing programmers to keep their code [[DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself|DRY]].

More generally, the concept of calling applies to the invocation of any callable entity, such as a [[Function (CS)|function]], [[Constructor (CS)|constructor]], or [[Procedure (CS)|procedure]].
