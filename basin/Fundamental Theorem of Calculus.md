The net area under a curveâ€”that is, between two points, is the difference of its [[Antiderivative|antiderivative]] between those two points. 

Through this theorem we bridge the gap between differentiation and integration, proving their inverse relationship. The first part of the theorem demonstrates how differentiation undoes integration, while the second gives out the practical method through which integrals are solved.
