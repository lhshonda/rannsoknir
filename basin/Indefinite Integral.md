The directive reverse of a [[Derivative|derivative]], the [[Antiderivative|antiderivative]]. The indefinite integral of a function represents a family of [[Function|functions]] that when [[Derivative|differentiated]], give us the function we had before performing integration. 

In order to account for the different possibilities the [[Constant of Integration|constant of integration]], $C$, is used and represents all possible [[Constant|constants]]. 

Keep the [[Integration Rules|integration rules]] in mind when solving indefinite integrals.

$$
\begin{gather} \\
\int f(x) \, d=F(x)+C \\ \\ \\
f(x) \to \text{The Integrand} \\ \\
F(x)+C \to \text{Antiderivative of }f(x) \\ \\
C\to \text{Constant of Integration}
\end{gather}

##### Example

For $\large{6x^{2}}$, the power of $\large{x}$ is raised from  $\large{2\to 3}$, and then the term is divided by the new power. The constant gains a a variable to become $\large{5x}$. We then combine both antiderivatives and add the constant of integration.

$$
\begin{gather}
\int (6x^{2}+5) \, dx =2x^{3}+5x+C
\end{gather}
