It refers to the velocity of an object at a specific instance in [[time]], after having traveled for some duration, $t$, with constant acceleration. Not to be confused with an object's [[Terminal Velocity|terminal velocity]].

Starting from the assumption of [[constant]] acceleration, we're able to create an [[equation]] solving for the **final velocity** of an object.

$$
\begin{gather}\\
a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{t} \\ \\
\text{Both sides are multiplied by }t \text{, and } v_{f} \text{ is isolated.} \\ \\
v_{f}=v_{i}+at \\
\end{gather}
$$

>Finding **final velocity** without time.

If you don't know (and don't need to find) time, given constant acceleration, you can solve its equation for time. 
$$
\begin{gather} \\
t=\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{a} \\ \\
\text{Swap this equivalent expression into displacement from average velocity.} \\ \\
\Delta x=\bar{v}\cdot t \to \left(\frac{v_{i}+v_{f}}{2}\right) \cdot\left( \frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{a} \right) \\ \\
\text{Once rearranged, simply solve for }v^{2}_{f}\text{.} \\ \\
2a \Delta x = \left((v_{i}+v_{f})(v_{f}-v_{i})\right) \to (\cancel{ v_{i}v_{f} }-v^{2}_{i}+v^{2}_{f}-\cancel{ v_{f}v_{i} }) \\ \\
v^{2}_{f}=2a\Delta x+v^{2}_{i}

\end{gather}
$$
