If two [[Operand|operands]] in division are both [[Integer (CS)|integers]], the operator performs [[Integer Division (CS)|integer division]] and will not generate any [[Fraction|fractional]] part regardless of input.  At least one of the operands must be a [[Floating-Type|floating-type]] number in order for floating-point division to occur.
