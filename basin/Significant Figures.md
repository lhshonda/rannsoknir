Significant figures is seen as the number of digits in a number that specify its accuracy. They are seen as the digits in a measurement that are known with certainty, plus another digit that is an estimate.

If you had a measuring stick that had a millimeter as the smallest diving unit then you can't with certainty measure anything besides it. You may, however, estimate half or a quarter of a millimeter. 

###### Rules
1. All non-zero numbers are significant. 
	1. 12.372 has 5 sig figs.
2. Leading zeros are not significant.
	1. 0.0032 has 2 sig figs.
3. Trailing zeros in a number without a decimal are not significant.
	1. 4000 has 1 sig fig.
4. Trailing zeros in a number with a decimal are significant.
	1. 4.000 has 4 sig figs.
5. Exact numbers do not change the number of sig figs in operations.

$$
3.0000 \text{ has 5 significant figures, but 3.0 only has 2 significant figures.}
$$

$$
\text{The number of significant figures used for the product of two numbers is denoted}\atop\text{by factor with the least significant figures. }
$$

$$

(3.0000 \times 10^{3})\times(3.0\times 10^{2})=9.0\times 10^{5}\atop
\text{The result is represented by 2 significant figures in this case.}

$$

In the event you are to perform operations with exact numbers they would not change the number of significant figures for a result. It is acceptable to keep one or two extra digits during intermediate steps of a calculation. 

You are looking to minimize the round-off errors in the calculation, thus you may keep all digits if possible. The 1-2 extra digit rule is there for convenience and contextual sufficiency.
