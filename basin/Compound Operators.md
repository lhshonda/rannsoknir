```java
// Compound operators combine an operation and an assignment.

double x = 10.0;

// This long-form expression:
x = x + 5; // x is now 15.0

// ...is the same as this compound operator:
x += 5;    // x is now 20.0

// --- Other Examples ---
x -= 8;    // Equivalent to: x = x - 8;
x *= 3;    // Equivalent to: x = x * 3;
x /= 6;    // Equivalent to: x = x / 6;
```
