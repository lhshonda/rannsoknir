A Riemann Sum is an approximation of the area under a curve. There are different types of Riemann sums. They use a finite, countable number of rectangles.

$$

**Finding a sum given a function**: When looking to approximate the area under a curve for any function between two intervals, you may use a number of rectangles dictated by the amount of subdivisions you look to perform.

>Riemann sums contain what we refer to as subdivisions/partitions. These terms refer the amount of rectangles used, or rather the number of parts the interval being measured was divided into.

$$
\begin{gather}
\text{In the case of } x^2+1\text{, suppose we want to utilize 4 subdivisions.} \\
\text{Furthermore we want to approximate the area between } x=1\text{, and }x=3\text{.} \\

\end{gather}
$$

In order to find the size of the subdivisions, given they're to be uniform in length, you can assume that a subdivision is the final interval position subtracted by the initial interval position over the total number of subdivisions:

$$
\begin{gather}
\Delta x= \frac{x_{f}-x_{i}}{\text{n of divisions}} = \frac{3-1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{gather}
$$

The uniform subdivisions serve as the value of each rectangle's base. The heights used to calculate the area under the curve depend on the type of Riemann sum used. 

$$
\begin{gather}
\text{As the bases are}= \Delta x \text{, the heights are the last items of importance.} \\
\text{Solving for a left Riemann sum requires the use of the left boundaries.} \\
\\
f(1)\cdot \Delta x \:+f(1.5)\cdot \Delta x \:+f(2)\cdot \Delta x \:+f(2.5)\cdot \Delta x = \text{Approx. Area} \\ \\

\frac{1}{2}\cdot(17.5)=8.75
\end{gather}
$$

**Finding a sum using a table/values**: Given points $\text{(1, 6), (4, 8), (7, 3), and (10, 5).}$ Find the area underneath the curve using a right Riemann sum with three equal subdivisions for the graph of $f$ from $x=1$ to $x=10$.

> The given points do not give an exact picture of what the function might look like on the graph. This, however, does not prevent us from performing an approximation utilizing a Riemann sum.

- Since we are solving for the right Riemann sum, we look to use the right boundary of the subdivisions provided.

$$
\begin{gather}
\text{The sum is simply the added area of the provided rectangles in respect to direction.} \\
\text{The heights 8, 3, and 5 are used. All rectangles have a base of 3 here.} \\ (3\cdot 8)+(3\cdot 3)+(3\cdot 5) = 48

\end{gather}
$$

> This approximation isn't inherently bad or good without an understanding of the nature of $f$ in its entirety.
