The value approached as an argument approaches some value.

$$
\begin{gather}
\lim_{ x \to \text{ a} } f(x) = L  \\ \\

\text{As } x \text{ gets close to } a\text{, }f(x)\text{ gets close to }L\text{.}
\end{gather}
$$

> When taking the limit of expressions, by definition, we implicitly treat said expression as a defined function of an argument. It's done so for the sake and context of the limit process itself, not as an assertion of an equation, or a full invocation of all properties of [[Function|functions]].

--- 

The direction of approach is dictated by a positive/negative superscript on the argument. When calculating two sided limits, the value approached from both direction must be the same.

$\displaystyle \lim_{ x \to \text{ a}^{+} }f(x) \text{ approaches a from the right.}$
$\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to \text{ a}^{-} }f(x) \text{ approaches a from the left.}$

Here, $a$ is the argument and the $\pm$ constitutes the direction of approach.

In the event passing an argument into an expression directly outputs a real number within its domain, then you may consider the output the limit itself. This does not constitute a function's output as the limit, but instead allows for its output to be observed as the value approached for the argument. 

>*Discontinuous functions may still contain two-sided limits at said discontinuous points.*

$$
\begin{gather}
\lim_{ x \to 1 } f\left(x\right)=\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} \\
\text{As }x\text{ approaches }1\text{ the limit is 2 yet the function is} \\
\text{undefined at that point.}
\end{gather}
$$

When solving limits, you may pass in an argument and an expression may result in an something such as an [[Indeterminate Form|indeterminate form]]. Said limits determined with methods such as [[L'Hôpital's Rule|L'Hôpital's rule]] or by simply graphing the function if allowed. 

$$
\begin{gather}
\lim_{ x \to 1 } \frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{0} \\
\end{gather}
