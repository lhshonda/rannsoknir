A measure of the nearness of two figures. For two numbers to be within an **order of magnitude** of each other, their ratio, no matter the order of division, must be between 0.1 and 10.

The approximation of a quantity to one significant figure expressed with order of magnitude in mind would take a number such as $780000$ and turn it to $8\times 10^{5}$.
