The name assigned to elements such as [[Variable (CS)|variables]], [[Method (CS)|methods]], [[Class (OOP)|classes]], or [[Object (CS)|objects]].  They can include letter, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Identifiers may **not** start with digits. 

Most identifiers begin with a letter and follow the [[Camel Case|camelCase]] naming style for variables and methods, and [[Pascal Case|PascalCase]] for classes. Identifiers share some conventions across [[Programming Languages|languages]], but this isn't always the case, and it's best you consult the appropriate [[API Documentation|documentation]].
