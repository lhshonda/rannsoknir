A literal is a fixed value written in code. They are constant and do not change some types of [[Variable (CS)|variables]]. Though this makes a literal sound to be a [[Constant Variable (CS)|constant variable]], they are in fact not variables. Literals are stored in variables, they're not variables themselves.
