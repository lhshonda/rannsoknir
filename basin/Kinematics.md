This branch in physics that studies and describes the motion of points, bodies, and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause them to move.

It does not ask why the element in motion takes the the trajectory it takes. The "why" falls upon the realm of [[Dynamics|dynamics]].

Thus, kinematics serves as the foundation through which one explains motion before seeking to explain its causes.

###### Scalar v. Vector

Scalar quantities only contain magnitude.
	Mass, for example, would be a scalar quantity. Direction would not apply for mass.
	Distance is a scalar quantity, while displacement would be a vector quantity.
	Similarly, temperature is a scalar quantity.


Vector quantities contain both magnitude and direction.
	Displacement can be see as distance with direction.
	Acceleration is a vector quantity as it tells you how fast the velocity is changing.

##### Distance v. Displacement

Displacement could be expressed as $d = x_{f}-x_{o}$ where $f$ is the final position while $o$ is the original.

Given a person traveled 13 meters east. That person then turns around and travels 4 meters west. The distance traveled would be 17 meters, while the displacement would be 9 meters east.

##### Speed v. Velocity

Speed only has magnitude while velocity contains both magnitude and direction.

Speed: $s$
Average speed: $\bar{s}$

$$
\bar{s}= \frac{\text{distance}}{time}
$$
$$
\bar{v}=\frac{\text{displacement}}{time} \text{ or } \frac{x_{f}-x_{o}}{t}
$$


Speed is always positive while velocity may be both negative or positive.

Given a particle:
	moves 100 meters east
	moves 150 meters west 
	all of this is done in a time interval of 5 seconds

This particle's average speed would be:
$$
\bar{s}=\frac{250m}{5s} = 50 \text{ m/s}
$$
The average velocity instead would be:
$$
\bar{v}=\frac{-50m}{5s}= -10 \text{ m/s}
$$

##### Instantaneous Speed v. Instantaneous Velocity

Instantaneous speed, $s$, is the same as the [[Magnitude|magnitude]] of instantaneous velocity, thus:
$$
s= |v|
$$

##### Formulas

**Constant Speed:** In this equation  $d$  may represent distance or displacement. In the case of $v$, it can be used for both speed & velocity as we are dealing with constant speed. 

You may not, however, expect to represent distance if you are to use $v$ in the sense of velocity instead of speed.

$$
d=vt
$$

When dealing with constant speed:

$$
v=\bar{v}
$$

**Constant Acceleration:** For this case, you must take into account a few different formulas.

$$
d=\bar{v}t
$$

The reason $d$ is defined as such in the case of **constant acceleration** is because:

$$
v\neq \bar{v}
$$

Acceleration indicates a change in velocity so the average velocity would be equal to all velocities at all given times.

In order to find $\bar{v}$, you must perform:

$$
\bar{v}=\frac{v_{o}+v_{f}}{2}
$$

Where the initial initial velocity and the final velocity are added then divided by 2. If this were to replace $\bar{v}$, you may then assume that to solve $d$ you can:

$$
d=\frac{1}{2}(v_{o}+v_{f})t
$$
In the case you are solving for distance, then $v_{o}$ and $v_{f}$ would represent beginning and final speed instead.

###### Turning Point

Commonly referred towards as a turning point, this is the instance of time an object might reach a velocity of 0 (near-zero), and begin to gain velocity in the opposite direction.
