A formula used to describe the equation of a line knowing its slope and the coordinates of at least one point its domain.

$$
\begin{gather}
y−y_{1}​=m(x−x_{1}​) \\ \\
\text{Slope: }m \\
\text{Known point: }(x_{1}​,y_{1}​)
\end{gather}
$$


The slope of a straight line is constant everywhere. It can be described as **rise over run** as its behavior is unchanging. When calculating the slope the equation itself is already there. It's rearranged to look like the one shown above to look more friendly. 

$$
\frac{y−y_{1}}{x−x_{1}}​​=m
$$

> The point-slope formula is the definition of slope in disguise!
