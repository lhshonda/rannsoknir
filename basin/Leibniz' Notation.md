This notation, named after [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], represents the [[Derivative|derivative]] of a [[Function (Math)|function]] in respect to another [[Variable|variable]], which in this case is $\large{x}$. The right side uses [[Lagrange's Notation|Lagrange's notation]] of the derivative of $\large{f}$ at $\large{x}$.
